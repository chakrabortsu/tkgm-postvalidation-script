Basic post Upgrade TKGm validation script

The script will check
  -> Cluster status 
  -> Health of the nodes
  -> Health of the pods, services, deployments and ingress
  -> ClusterAPI resources status
  -> TKG version deployed currently

N.B. - The script is limited to perform basic Platform tasks and  will not validate any application functionality
