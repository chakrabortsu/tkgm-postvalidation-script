Basic post Upgrade TKGm validation script

The script will check: <br />
  -> Cluster status<br /> 
  -> Health of the nodes<br />
  -> Health of the pods, services, deployments and ingress<br />
  -> ClusterAPI resources status<br />
  -> TKG version deployed currently<br />

N.B. - The script is limited to perform basic Platform tasks and  will not validate any application functionality
